## Introduction to Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. It helps track changes, manage code versions, and collaborate efficiently.

### Key Features
- Distributed Version Control
- Branching and Merging
- Staging Area
- Commit History
- Remote Repositories

## Basic Commands

### Initializing a Repository
```sh
git init
```
Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

### Cloning a Repository
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
```
Clones an existing repository from a remote server.

### Checking the Status
```sh
git status
```
Displays the status of the working directory and staging area.

### Adding Changes
```sh
git add <file>
```
Adds changes in the specified file to the staging area.

### Committing Changes
```sh
git commit -m "Commit message"
```
Commits the staged changes with a descriptive message.

### Viewing the Commit History
```sh
git log
```
Displays the commit history of the repository.

## Branching and Merging

### Creating a Branch
```sh
git branch <branch-name>
```
Creates a new branch with the specified name.

### Switching Branches
```sh
git checkout <branch-name>
```
Switches to the specified branch.

### Merging Branches
```sh
git merge <branch-name>
```
Merges the specified branch into the current branch.

### Deleting a Branch
```sh
git branch -d <branch-name>
```
Deletes the specified branch.

## Remote Repositories

### Adding a Remote
```sh
git remote add <remote-name> <remote-url>
```
Adds a new remote repository with the specified name and URL.

### Fetching Changes
```sh
git fetch <remote-name>
```
Fetches changes from the specified remote repository.

### Pulling Changes
```sh
git pull <remote-name> <branch-name>
```
Fetches and merges changes from the specified branch of the remote repository.

### Pushing Changes
```sh
git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
```
Pushes local changes to the specified branch of the remote repository.

## Best Practices

1. **Write Descriptive Commit Messages**: Use clear and concise commit messages to describe the changes.
2. **Commit Frequently**: Commit changes frequently to keep the commit history granular and manageable.
3. **Use Branches**: Use branches to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.
4. **Pull Before Pushing**: Always pull changes from the remote repository before pushing your changes.
5. **Review Changes**: Review changes before committing to ensure code quality and consistency.

### Example `.gitignore`
```gitignore
# Node.js
node_modules/
dist/

# Logs
logs/
*.log

# OS generated files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```
