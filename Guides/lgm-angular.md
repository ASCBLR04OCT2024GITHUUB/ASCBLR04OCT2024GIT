## Introduction to Angular

Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. It is developed and maintained by Google.
- Angular provides a comprehensive set of features for building complex web applications, including data binding, dependency injection, routing, and forms handling.
- Angular applications are built using components, which are reusable, self-contained units that encapsulate the HTML, CSS, and TypeScript code for a specific part of the application.
- Angular applications are typically organized into modules, which are collections of related components, services, and other code.
- Angular provides a powerful command-line interface (CLI) for creating, building, and testing applications.
- Angular applications can be deployed to various platforms, including the web, mobile, and desktop.
- Angular follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, where the model represents the data, the view represents the UI, and the controller manages the communication between the model and the view.
- Angular uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, which provides static typing, classes, and interfaces to help build more robust and maintainable applications.
- Angular applications can be tested using various testing frameworks, including Jasmine and Karma for unit testing, and Protractor for end-to-end testing.
- Angular has a large and active community, with many resources, tutorials, and libraries available to help developers build applications more efficiently. Protractor is being phased out. Angular now recommends Cypress or Selenium WebDriver for end-to-end testing.
- Angular is widely used in the industry and is a popular choice for building modern web applications.  
- Angular versioning starts from Angular 2+. The original AngularJS (1.x) is a different framework.
- Angular includes powerful RxJS integration for reactive programming.
- Angular Universal enables server-side rendering (SSR).

## Component-Based Architecture

Angular applications are built using components, which are the basic building blocks of the UI. Components are reusable, self-contained units that encapsulate the HTML, CSS, and TypeScript code for a specific part of the application. Components can communicate with each other using inputs and outputs.  

**Example:**
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'my-angular-app';
}
```

## Two-Way Data Binding
Angular provides two-way data binding, which allows for automatic synchronization of data between the model and the view. This means that changes in the model are reflected in the view, and vice versa. 

Syntax:
```html
<input [(ngModel)]="name" placeholder="Enter your name">
<p>Hello, {{name}}!</p>
```

## Dependency Injection
Angular has a built-in dependency injection system that makes it easy to manage and inject dependencies. This allows you to create services that can be shared across multiple components and modules.  

Syntax:
```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class DataService {
  getData() {
    return ['Data1', 'Data2', 'Data3'];
  }
}
```

## Angular CLI
Angular CLI is a command-line interface for Angular that makes it easy to create, build, and test Angular applications. It provides a set of commands for common tasks such as creating a new project, generating components, services, and modules, and running the development server.  

**Commands:**
- `ng new my-app`: Create a new Angular application
- `ng serve`: Run the development server
- `ng generate component my-component`: Generate a new component
- `ng build`: Build the application for production
- `ng test`: Run unit tests
- `ng e2e`: Run end-to-end tests
- `ng lint`: Run linting checks
- `ng deploy`: Deploy the application
- `ng help`: Get help on commands
- `ng update`: Update dependencies
- `ng add`: Add new capabilities to the project
- `ng config`: Get or set configuration values
- `ng doc`: Open the official Angular documentation
- `ng version`: Show Angular CLI version
- `ng xi18n`: Extract and update application translations
- `ng run`: Run Architect targets
- `ng analytics`: Share anonymous usage data with the Angular Team
- `ng completion`: Print Angular CLI completion script



## Routing
Angular's Router module enables navigation from one view to another within your application. You can define routes that map URLs to components, and the router will take care of loading the appropriate component when the URL changes.  

**Example:**
```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { AboutComponent } from './about/about.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent }
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
```

## Reactive Forms
Angular provides a powerful way to work with forms using reactive forms, which are built around observables and immutability. Reactive forms allow you to create complex forms with validation, error handling, and dynamic form controls. 

**Example:**
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { FormBuilder, FormGroup } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-form',
  templateUrl: './form.component.html'
})
export class FormComponent {
  form: FormGroup;

  constructor(private fb: FormBuilder) {
    this.form = this.fb.group({
      name: [''],
      email: ['']
    });
  }

  onSubmit() {
    console.log(this.form.value);
  }
}
```
By leveraging these features, you can build robust and efficient Angular applications. Happy coding!
